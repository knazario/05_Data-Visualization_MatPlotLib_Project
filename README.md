# 5_Data-Visualization_MatPlotLib_Project

This project takes 2 data sets from a drug regimen study in mice, merges, cleans and manipulates the data from both datasets in order to conduct some initial analysis on the dataset and look for trends in drug regimen impact on tumors in mice. Additionally, visualizations were generated in order to help identify potential outliers in the subgroups and conduct a linear regression on one of the subsets of data. Further analysis could be done to generate more insightful conclusions.
